# CodSoft Java Development Internship

Welcome to my repository for the Java programming tasks completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each task represents a distinct programming challenge aimed at enhancing Java programming skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Task 1: Number Game

### Description
- **Objective:** Guess the randomly generated number within a specified range.
- **Features:**
  1. Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
  2. Prompts the user to guess the number.
  3. Provides feedback (correct, too high, too low) based on the user's guess.
  4. Limits the number of attempts.
  5. Allows multiple rounds of gameplay.
  6. Displays the user's score based on rounds won or attempts taken.

## Task 2: Student Grade Calculator

### Description
- **Objective:** Calculate grades based on marks obtained in subjects.
- **Features:**
  1. Takes input of marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
  2. Calculates total marks and average percentage.
  3. Assigns grades based on the average percentage achieved.
  4. Displays total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

## Task 3: ATM Interface

### Description
- **Objective:** Simulate an ATM machine interface with banking functionalities.
- **Features:**
  1. Represents an ATM machine and user's bank account.
  2. Provides options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking balance.
  3. Implements methods like `withdraw(amount)`, `deposit(amount)`, and `checkBalance()`.
  4. Validates user input to ensure transaction feasibility.
  5. Displays appropriate messages based on transaction success or failure.

## Task 4: Currency Converter

### Description
- **Objective:** Convert currency based on real-time exchange rates.
- **Features:**
  1. Allows selection of base and target currencies.
  2. Fetches real-time exchange rates from a reliable API.
  3. Takes user input for the amount to convert.
  4. Converts the amount from the base currency to the target currency using fetched rates.
  5. Displays the converted amount and the target currency symbol to the user.

## Usage
